We aim to assess their vulnerability by creating effective attack strategies and developing defense approaches to enhance their adversarial robustness.\n\u2022 Adversarial Robustness of Graph-based Anomaly Detection: lots of graph analytic tools (e.g., social network analysis tools, GNNs, etc.) are used for anomaly detection. We study how to attack these tools and further develop defense approaches to make them robust.\n\u2022 Security of Signed Graph Analysis: we study the security issues of analytic tasks over a specifical type of graphs termed signed graphs."

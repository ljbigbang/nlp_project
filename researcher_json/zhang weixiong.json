        "content": "The work in the Zhang lab in this broad field is mainly computational and falls into the category of Data Sciences (or Big Data). We aim to find and understand biological \u201cstories\u201d through building models and identifying patterns from large quantities of genome-scale biological data. In the process, we integrate the bench work of molecular biology and develop novel methods and efficient software tools along the way. In this broad area, we pursue two overarching themes,network systems biology and gene regulation via noncoding RNA genes. We are interested in basic biological questions (e.g., the biogenesis of small noncoding RNAs, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation) and their applications to complex diseases (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and psoriasis) and plant stress response (e.g., rice blast and rice bacterial blight)."

The work has made significant contributions to the understanding of the nature and complexity of many search techniques, such as best-first search and depth-first branch-and-bound, and combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and Constraint Satisfaction."

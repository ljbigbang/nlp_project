    "personal background": "<The researcher's background includes a long history of research on heuristic search, planning, and optimization. The work has made significant contributions to the understanding of the nature and complexity of many search techniques, such as best-first search and depth-first branch-and-bound, and combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and Constraint Satisfaction.",
    "research interest": "<Research Areas:\n\n1. Molecular/Cellular Biology: Biogenesis and function of noncoding transcripts\n2. Genetics/Genomics: Genetic architecture and transcriptome of complex traits and diseases\n3. Multi-omic disease study: Etiology and biomarker discovery by integrating genomic, imagery, and phenotypic information\n4. Big data analytics and AI: Algorithm for massive biological data analysis, biological foundation models (large language models), and applications\n\n<p align=\"left\">\nThe work in the Zhang lab focuses on two overarching themes:\n1. Network systems biology\n2. Gene regulation via noncoding RNA genes.\nResearch interests include basic biological questions such as biogenesis of small noncoding RNAs, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation, and their applications to complex diseases (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and psoriasis) and plant stress response (e.g., rice blast and rice bacterial blight).</p>",

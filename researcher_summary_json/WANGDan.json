I am receiving too many emails to set up a formal meeting time.\n\nTo fellow students:\nI am currently working on using pricing solutions to better match Internet resource supply and demand [SDP'14][INFOCOM'14a][SIGMETRICS'15][INFOCOM'16a]. In the past, I have studied backup paths for Internet routing [ICDCS'09][Globecom10], Forwarding (FIB) compression [INFOCOM'11][INFOCOM'14b], Internet routing for energy conservation [ICNP'13][INFOCOM'16b], measurement of Internet protocols in high mobility environments [ICNP'14][INFOCOM'15]. I contributed to address driven network (ADN), a new architecture, led by Tsinghua University. We studied two dimensional IP routing [ICNC'13][INFOCOM'14b][Internetdraft]. More information on this can be found <https://www.adn.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/our-work/two-dimentional-ip-routing/>.\n\nSmart Building:\nBuilding is a central point of my study on smart building started from wireless sensor networks. In the past, I have studied structural health monitoring of high-rise buildings [INFOCOM'10][INFOCOM'12a][TMC'12]. In particular, our worked on Guangzhou New TV Tower. More information on this can be found <https://www.gdnu.edu.cn/AboutUs/AboutUs.html>. \n\nI am currently focusing on building energy efficiency [INFOCOM'12b][RTSS'13], and thermal comfort of people [Buildsys'13][e-Energy'14][Buildsys'14]. It should be noted that buildings are constructed to serve people, not to serve energy efficiency. Some more information on this can be found <https://www.gdnu.edu.cn/AboutUs/SmartBuilding.html>.",

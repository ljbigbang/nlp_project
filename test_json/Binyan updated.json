Prior to joining PolyU, I was a Visiting research Scientist in Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University, under the supervision of Professor Stephen Fienberg. I received my Ph.D. in Statistica and Applied Probability from National University of Singapore in 2012 (Supervisor: Prof. Wei-Liem Loh), and my bachelor's degree in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2007. I am generally interested in different areas in statistics and applied probability with a current emphasis on network data analysis, high-dimensional data analysis, and statistical machine learning.\n\n\n\nI am looking for PhD students, RA and Postdoc.
